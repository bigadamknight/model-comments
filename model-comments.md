**Specification and Development Plan for a VS Code Extension to Show/Hide LLM-Specific Comments**

---

**Introduction**

You aim to create a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that can toggle the visibility of comments specifically intended for Large Language Models (LLMs). These comments help LLMs understand and generate code better but may clutter the workspace for developers. The extension will allow users to hide or show these comments seamlessly, improving readability without removing valuable context for LLMs.

---

### **Objectives**

1. **Identify LLM-Specific Comments**
   - Define a unique identifier or pattern for comments meant for LLMs.
   - Ensure the identifier does not conflict with standard comment syntax.

2. **Toggle Visibility**
   - Provide an easy way to show or hide LLM-specific comments (e.g., commands, keyboard shortcuts, UI buttons).
   - Remember the user's preference across sessions.

3. **Customization**
   - Allow users to customize the special identifier used for LLM comments.
   - Enable language-specific settings if needed.

4. **Performance**
   - Ensure the extension performs efficiently, even with large codebases.
   - Minimize impact on VS Code's responsiveness.

5. **User Experience**
   - Integrate seamlessly with the VS Code interface.
   - Provide feedback or indicators when comments are hidden.

---

### **Implementation Approach**

#### **1. Special Comment Identifier**

- **Format Examples:**
  - Single-line comments: `// LLM: This is a comment for LLMs`
  - Multi-line comments: `/* LLM: This is a comment for LLMs */`
  - Hash-based comments: `# LLM: This is a comment for LLMs`

- **Customization:**
  - Allow users to define their own identifier in the extension settings.
  - Support regular expressions for advanced patterns.

#### **2. Text Decorations**

- Use VS Code's [TextEditorDecorationType](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#TextEditorDecorationType) API.
- Apply decorations to modify the appearance of text without altering the underlying code.
- To hide comments:
  - Set `opacity` to `0` or `color` to `transparent`.
  - Optionally, adjust `fontSize` to `0` or use `display: none` if supported.

#### **3. Commands and Shortcuts**

- **Commands:**
  - `Show LLM Comments`: Reveals all LLM-specific comments.
  - `Hide LLM Comments`: Hides all LLM-specific comments.
  - `Toggle LLM Comments`: Switches between showing and hiding.

- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - Assign default shortcuts that can be customized by the user.

#### **4. Settings and Customization**

- **Extension Settings:**
  - `llmComments.identifier`: String or regex pattern to identify LLM comments.
  - `llmComments.defaultState`: `"show"` or `"hide"` upon opening a file.
  - `llmComments.languages`: Language-specific configurations if needed.

---

### **Development Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Core Functionality**

1. **Detecting LLM Comments**

   - Use the `vscode.workspace.onDidOpenTextDocument` and `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument` events.
   - Parse the document text to find matches based on the user-defined identifier.
   - Store ranges of LLM-specific comments.

2. **Applying Text Decorations**

   - Create two decoration types:
     - **Visible Decoration**: Default text style.
     - **Hidden Decoration**: Styles to hide the text.
   - Apply decorations to the ranges of detected comments based on the visibility state.

3. **Toggling Visibility**

   - Implement the commands to toggle visibility.
   - Update decorations when the state changes.

#### **Phase 2: User Interface Enhancements**

1. **Command Palette Integration**

   - Register commands in `package.json`.
   - Provide descriptions and categories for easy access.

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**

   - Define default keybindings in `package.json`.
   - Example:
     ```json
     "keybindings": [
       {
         "command": "extension.toggleLLMComments",
         "key": "ctrl+alt+l",
         "when": "editorTextFocus"
       }
     ]
     ```

3. **Status Bar Item**

   - Add a status bar item to indicate the current state (shown or hidden).
   - Allow users to click the item to toggle visibility.

4. **Settings UI**

   - Define configuration settings in `package.json` with scopes and descriptions.
   - Use VS Code's settings UI for user-friendly customization.

#### **Phase 3: Testing**

1. **Unit Testing**

   - Write tests using Mocha and Chai frameworks.
   - Test pattern matching, decoration application, and command execution.

2. **Integration Testing**

   - Use the VS Code Extension Tester framework.
   - Simulate user interactions and verify the extension's behavior.

3. **Performance Testing**

   - Test with large files and multiple languages.
   - Profile the extension to identify and optimize any bottlenecks.

#### **Phase 4: Documentation**

1. **README.md**

   - Explain the extension's purpose and features.
   - Provide installation instructions.
   - Include usage examples with screenshots or GIFs.

2. **CHANGELOG.md**

   - Document changes for each version.

3. **Contribution Guidelines**

   - Encourage community contributions.
   - Outline code standards and submission processes.

#### **Phase 5: Publishing**

1. **Prepare for Release**

   - Update `package.json` with appropriate versioning.
   - Ensure all metadata fields are completed.

2. **Package the Extension**

   - Use `vsce` to package:
     ```bash
     vsce package
     ```

3. **Publish to Marketplace**

   - Create a publisher account on [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
   - Publish the extension:
     ```bash
     vsce publish
     ```

4. **Post-Publishing**

   - Monitor for user feedback and reviews.

### **Alternative Implementation Methods**

#### **1. Code Folding**

- **Description:**
  - Utilize VS Code's code folding capabilities to collapse LLM-specific comments.

- **Implementation:**
  - Define custom folding ranges using `vscode.FoldingRangeProvider`.
  - Automatically fold these ranges on file open.

- **Pros:**
  - Leverages built-in editor features.
  - Users can manually expand/collapse sections.

- **Cons:**
  - Folding indicators remain visible.
  - May interfere with other folding functionalities.

#### **2. Hidden Regions with Special Markers**

- **Description:**
  - Use special markers to define regions that can be hidden.

- **Format Example:**
  ```javascript
  // #region LLM
  // LLM-specific comment
  // #endregion
  ```

- **Implementation:**
  - Similar to code folding, but with explicit region markers.
  - Use decorations to hide the entire region.

- **Pros:**
  - Clear delineation of LLM comment blocks.
  - Compatible with languages that support regions.

- **Cons:**
  - Not all languages support region markers.
  - Adds additional syntax to the code.

#### **3. External Annotation Files**

- **Description:**
  - Store LLM comments in separate files or metadata.

- **Implementation:**
  - Link code files with annotation files.
  - LLMs process annotations alongside code.

- **Pros:**
  - Keeps code files clean.
  - No need to manipulate visibility within the editor.

- **Cons:**
  - Requires changes to how LLMs access code.
  - Increases complexity in file management.

---

### **Considerations and Recommendations**

- **LLM Compatibility**
  - Ensure that hiding comments in the editor does not prevent LLMs from accessing them.
  - The extension should only affect the editor's display, not the actual file content.

- **Collaboration Tools**
  - Be mindful of how hidden comments appear in version control systems.
  - Hidden comments are still present in the file and will show up in diffs and merges.

- **User Experience**
  - Provide visual cues when comments are hidden, such as subtle markers or status bar messages.
  - Ensure that the toggle actions are intuitive and responsive.

- **Extensibility**
  - Design the extension to be easily extendable for future features.
  - Consider supporting additional functionalities like syntax highlighting for LLM comments.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **Prototype Development**
   - Build a minimal viable product (MVP) to test core functionalities.
   - Gather initial feedback from a small group of users.

2. **Feedback Iteration**
   - Use feedback to refine features and fix issues.
   - Prioritize enhancements based on user needs.

3. **Community Engagement**
   - Encourage users to contribute ideas and report bugs.
   - Consider open-sourcing the project for collaborative development.
